            "In 2022, Itaú—the largest bank in Latin America—launched Itu, its first fully digital B2C product in Chile. The product was built on a clear differentiation strategy grounded in three simple pillars, deeply connected to insights from research with Chilean consumers: everyday simplicity, transparency that builds trust, and education that empowers financial autonomy.",
            "A key part of this strategy is Chanchitus—digital money spaces that allow customers to separate and organize funds for different goals. More than following a trend among digital banks, Chanchitus respond to a common local behavior of using multiple banks to segment money, enabling customers to manage their finances within a single app while maintaining a unified financial view."

            "The work resulted in nearly 50 concepts outlining a vision for a hyper-personalized and context-aware TV experience powered by AI. Several concepts addressed the declining relevance of traditional live TV by enhancing on-demand viewing through smarter content curation and adaptation to individual viewing behaviors—such as breaking movies into shorter episodes or assembling personalized on-demand schedules from live content.",
            "At the same time, the concepts strengthened live experiences where they still matter most, with sports as a key focus. Ideas included personalized sports timelines and live social interaction layers. Together, concepts around personalization, intent recognition, and second-screen interaction connected live and on-demand viewing, outlining a future where TV is intelligent, adaptive, and deeply personal."

            "In Brazil, smart home solutions remain a niche category, and adoption is mainly limited by perceived complexity among mass-market customers, rather than price. To address this, Vivo leveraged its nationwide workforce to offer in-home consulting and installation. Reducing friction not only in adoption but also in daily use, the Vivo Casa Inteligente app was designed as a simple control layer, validated through usability testing with Vivo’s target audience, and tailored to be more accessible for this segment than tools such as Google Home, Amazon Alexa, or Smart Life. The app combines device control, integrated support, and lightweight educational content.",
            "To build awareness at scale, an educational experience was also added to Vivo’s main app. It explains the smart home offering and allows customers to explore it through a guided virtual tour, helping a broad audience understand the value of connected-home solutions before adoption."

A restrained modernist interface minimizes visual friction and keeps focus on the photography, helping users explore projects, form intent, and move naturally toward contact. Subtle motion—such as shifting shadows or gentle movement in trees—adds a tactile quality to the experience, encouraging deeper engagement with the spaces. By combining emotional resonance with clarity and usability, the site strengthens connection with the brand and supports high-quality lead generation."

On mobile, videos were introduced at key moments of the journey to balance brand storytelling with performance, supporting faster decisions and higher confidence during checkout."
